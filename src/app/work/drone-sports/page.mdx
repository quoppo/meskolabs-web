  <h1 className="text-3xl font-semibold">Overview</h1>
  <span className="text-justify">
    Drone Soccer is a fast-paced team sport where players pilot drones in an
    enclosed arena. The goal is to fly the "Striker" drone through the
    opponent's goal while defending your own with "Blockers." The game combines
    strategy, precision, and teamwork as drones maneuver and collide in exciting
    aerial action. It promotes STEM learning through drone design and
    programming, making it both a thrilling sport and an educational experience.
  </span>
  <span className="text-justify">
    The sport is a result of a collaborative effort between MeskoLabs and Drone
    Soccer India, bringing together innovation and expertise to create a new
    form of entertainment. The combination of cutting-edge drone technology with
    the strategic gameplay of soccer results in a dynamic experience for both
    players and spectators. The arena, with its illuminated goals and enclosed
    space, adds to the intensity of the matches, creating an immersive
    environment.

    The complete Project involved Two major things: The Arena and Drones

    <span className="text-justify">
      <span className="text-lg font-bold">Protective Netting: </span>
      The arena was designed with a key focus on creating a protective net that
      is both easy to assemble and provides optimal visibility while ensuring
      safety for users and the drones.
    </span>
    <span className="text-justify">
      <span className="text-lg font-bold">Modular Assembly: </span>
      The netting system was engineered to be modular, enabling quick setup and
      disassembly, making it ideal for various deployment scenarios.
    </span>
    <span className="text-justify">
      <span className="text-lg font-bold">Safety and Durability: </span>
      The material used for the net was carefully selected to offer high
      durability, ensuring it can absorb the impact of drone collisions without
      compromising safety.

  <div className="flex flex-col space-y-10">
    <span className="text-justify">
      <span className="text-lg font-bold">Material Selection: </span>
      The process began with in-depth material exploration, focusing on key
      factors such as elasticity, rigidity, stiffness, and the geometrical
      properties of the casings. We tested various materials to strike the right
      balance between lightweight design and high impact resistance.
    </span>
    <span className="text-justify">
      <span className="text-lg font-bold">Geometrical Optimization: </span>
      To enhance durability, the design considered cross-sections and curvatures
      that minimize stress points while maintaining structural integrity. This
      was critical in ensuring the drones could withstand collisions without
      adding unnecessary weight.
    </span>
    <span className="text-justify">
      <span className="text-lg font-bold">Prototyping and Testing: </span>
      Over the course of 18-19 weeks, we conducted multiple iterations of
      prototypes, rigorously testing and refining the casings to ensure optimal
      performance. Each iteration focused on enhancing resistance to impact
      while minimizing weight.

      <span className="text-lg font-bold">Casing Integration: </span>
      Once the ideal casing design was finalized, we moved to the integration
      phase, where the casings were attached to the drones. This phase involved
      additional adjustments to ensure seamless attachment without compromising
      the drones' functionality or performance.
    </span>
    <span className="text-justify">
      <span className="text-lg font-bold">Outcome: </span>
      The final drone casings are both durable and lightweight, providing
      superior protection during collisions while maintaining agility. The
      protective arena and casings are now fully functional and aligned with the
      projectâ€™s objectives of safety, durability, and performance.
