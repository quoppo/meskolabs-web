    A key feature of this Delta robot is its use of carbon fiber in the arms,
    providing an excellent strength-to-weight ratio. This material choice not
    only enhances the robot's durability but also allows for faster movements
    with reduced inertia. The lightweight yet strong arms enable the robot to
    achieve high speeds while maintaining precise control, which is crucial for
    tasks that require both efficiency and accuracy.
  </span>
  <span className="text-justify">
    The design of the Delta robot also emphasizes flexibility and precision in
    the placement of its end effector. This ensures that the robot can perform
    tasks with a high degree of accuracy, even in complex or tight spaces. The
    combination of flexible structure, modularity, and the use of advanced
    materials like carbon fiber makes this Delta robot an ideal solution for
    industries that demand high performance and reliability.

  <h2 className="text-lg font-bold">Structure :</h2>
  <span className="text-justify">
    Kikobot D1 is designed with a focus on efficiency and precision by carefully
    selecting the right materials for each component. The base plate, made of
    steel, provides a strong and stable foundation, ensuring rigidity during
    high-speed operations. The active arms, constructed from lightweight carbon
    fiber tubes, allow for fast, accurate movements. The passive arms, also made
    from carbon fiber, help transfer motion while maintaining stability and
    control.
  </span>
  <span className="text-justify">
    We used 3D-printed carbon fiber motor covers to reduce weight around the
    motors, enhancing overall performance. The end effector mounting is designed
    to securely hold tools or grippers, ensuring precise control during tasks.
    This combination of materials and design choices makes Kikobot D1 both fast
    and reliable for various applications.

  <h2 className="text-lg font-bold">First Prototype</h2>
  <span className="text-justify">
    We have successfully developed the first working prototype of Kikobot D1,
    our Delta robot. The prototype features carbon fiber 3D-printed holders and
    motor covers, with all arms made from lightweight yet strong carbon fiber
    tubes. To ensure rigidity and stability, the upper base is constructed from
    a sturdy steel base plate. This design offers high precision and durability,
    making Kikobot D1 an efficient and reliable Delta robot. The combination of
    advanced materials and thoughtful engineering marks a significant milestone
    in its development.
